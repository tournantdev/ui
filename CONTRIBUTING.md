# Contributing

## Bugs

If you found a bug in one of our components, please open a [new bug issue](https://github.com/tournantdev/ui/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

Providing a reduced test case, e.g. in a [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), is much appreciated.

## Features & New Components

You want to contribute a component or add a missing feature? Thatâ€™s amazing. Before developing, though, we would ask you to start with a [feature request issue](https://github.com/tournantdev/ui/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=). Whyâ€™s that? Tournant UI does not try to provide _all_ UI patterns.

After we reviewed your proposal you can go full steam ahead. For developing please follow the _Fork & Pull Request_ workflow, as [explained here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962 'GitHub Standard Fork & Pull Request Workflow by Chaser134').

Pull Requests _should_ contain unit tests. However, if you are not sure how to write these tests, please do not hesitate to open a request. We can figure out how to add necessary tests together.

Pull Requests _must_ contain readme updates. Or a a readme for a new component that explains how to use it. We will not merge PRs that do not contain documentation.

You can scaffold all necessary files for a new component using the `yarn run create` command. This will run the [@tournant/scaffold](https://github.com/tournantdev/scaffold) CLI tool. The [corresponding readme](https://github.com/tournantdev/scaffold/blob/master/README.md) contains usage information.

Thanks. ðŸ’ž
