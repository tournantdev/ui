# Tournant UI

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/tournantdev/ui.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

In the kitchen, the _tournant_ is the person moving around, helping out.

Tournant UI aims to be this. For User Interfaces. Tournant UI will not replace your complete UI or dictate how to you design your elements.

But if you need to integrate inclusive components in your site, Tournant UI will be there. Like a helping hand.

## Note

This is still in early development. Many components needed are missing. If you are able to contribute, please do!

## Acknowledgment

Tournant is heavily inspired by projects such as Reach UI, Inclusive Components and Accessible App.

## Feedback & Contributions

Contributions are always welcome.

If you found a bug or want to request a feature, please open an [issue](https://github.com/ovlb/vue-a11y-combobox/issues/new 'New issue form of this project').

If you wrote an enhancement or fixed a bug, open a Pull Request. Please follow the _Fork & Pull Request_ workflow, as [explained here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962 'GitHub Standard Fork & Pull Request Workflow by Chaser134').

Pull Requests _should_ contain unit tests. However, if you are not sure how to write these tests, please do not hesitate to open a request. We can figure out how to add necessary tests together.

Thanks. üíû

## Development

If you want to improve the component, follow these steps.

First, you need to install the base dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Tournant UI uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). You will need to bootstrap the project folder:

```
yarn bootstrap
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Files are located in `/ui`.

```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

To build all packages run:

```
yarn build
```

üíÅ _Note:_ This builds the bundles that can be published to NPM. If you want to build the demo implementation in `./demo` use `yarn run build:ui`

### Run your tests

```
yarn run test
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
yarn run lint
```

### Run your unit tests

```
yarn run test:unit
```

## Author

The components were written by. But I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do this without the amazing community that has built around inclusive and accessible Web Development. Thanks.
