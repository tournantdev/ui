# Tournant UI

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/tournantdev/ui.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

In the kitchen, the _tournant_ is the person moving around, helping out.

Tournant UI aims to be this. For User Interfaces. Tournant UI will not replace your complete UI or dictate how to you design your elements.

But if you need to integrate inclusive components in your site, Tournant UI will be there. Like a helping hand.

## Note

This is still in early development. Many components needed are missing. If you are able to contribute, please do!

## Acknowledgment

Tournant is heavily inspired by projects such as Reach UI, Inclusive Components and Accessible App.

## Feedback & Contributions

Contributions are always welcome.

We have written down detailed [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please be aware that all contributions have to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Contributions of any kind which to not adhere to it will be removed. No exceptions will be made.

Thanks. üíû

## Development

If you want to improve the component, follow these steps.

Tournant UI uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). You will need to bootstrap the project folder:

```
yarn bootstrap
```

This will install all packages and hoist them to the project root folder.

To develop your components please use Storybook [as explained in the contribution documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md#storybook).

### Build packages

To build all packages run:

```
yarn build
```

üíÅ _Note:_ This builds the bundles that can be published to NPM. If you want to build the demo implementation in `./demo` use `yarn run build:ui`

### Run your tests

```
yarn run test
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
yarn run lint
```

### Publish Packages

```
yarn publish:packages
```

üíÅ _Note:_ You need to have access to the npm @tournant organisation to run this command.

## Authorship

Tournant UI is maintained by Marcus and Oscar. But, in reality, this project wouldn‚Äôt be possible without the amazing community that has evolved around inclusive web development. Thanks, y‚Äôall.

Special thanks to Ryan Florence and the [Reach UI](https://github.com/reach/reach-ui) project, from which we blatantly copied lots of the architecutural decisions and the idea itself.
