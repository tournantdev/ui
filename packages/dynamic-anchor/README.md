# @tournant/dynamic-anchor

A wrapper around `nuxt-link` or `router-link`, which falls back to a native `a` tag.

This is probably only useful if you donâ€™t have control over the Vue environment.

## Installation

No rocket science here. Although rockets are cool, to be honest. ðŸš€ You can install the component using NPM or Yarn.

```
npm install @tournant/dynamic-anchor --save
```

If you use Yarn:

```
yarn add @tournant/dynamic-anchor
```

Once the component is installed you need to import it wherever you want to use it.

```js
import TournantDynamicAnchor from '@tournant/dynamic-anchor'
```

Donâ€™t forget to add it to the registered components (been there, done that):

```js
components: {
  TournantDynamicAnchor,
  // ... all the other amazing components
}
```

## Usage

Since our packages might be used in a lot of different circumstances, we needed an agnostic link component that fares well under differing circumstances.

This component is a wrapper around Nuxt Link and Router Link. If Nuxt or @vue/router are detected it will pass the given link to `nuxt-link` or `router-link` respectively. If not, a HTML `a` element is rendered.

### Props

`@tournant/dynamic-anchor` extends the Router Link component. It takes one additional prop:

| Property             | Required | Type    | Default |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| useNativeLinkElement | false    | Boolean | false   |

If `useNativeLinkElement` is set to `true` the component will skip the check for Nuxt or Vue Router and always render an `a` tag.

You can use this prop if your site is gradually moving to Vue and some routes are not yet covered by your router implementation.

All other added props and attributes are bound to the component or, if a specific link component is detected, forwarded.
